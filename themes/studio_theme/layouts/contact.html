            <p>Hi Ralph,</p>
            <p>We're just getting settled into a new house Silsoe, and we've put out personal stamp on the interiors. However, the garden is still totally blank, and a friend recommended we get in touch with you. We've had a look through your portfolio, and love your work.</p>
            <p>We're very keen to introduce some planting and habitats for wildlife, around a new entertaining area. We'd also like to bring in some screening for privacy, and perhaps a contemporary water feature.</p>
            <p>We're not exactly sure about our budget, but we're probably looking to spend Â£30,000-50,000. If you could help us find a landscaper as well, that would be great.</p>
            <p>We look forward to hearing from you...</p>
