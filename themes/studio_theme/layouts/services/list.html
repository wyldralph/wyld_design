      <div class="process-steps-container">
        <ol>
          <li>Having a masterplan for your garden allows you to phase the project over a period of time, whilst ensuring everything works together in a unified way</li>
          <li>When approaching landscapers for quotes, having a masterplan and accompanying construction documentation ensures everybody is quoting for the same work, rather than interpreting a wishlist</li>
          <li>By having your garden designed, you'll get to decide how it's going to look before it's built. If you go straight to landscaping, you're relying on the landscaper's vision matching your own. If the patio is in the wrong place on a plan, it's much easier to change than if it's already been built!</li>
          <li>I'm a horticultural expert, and will design planting to thrive in your garden's unique conditions. This means less chance of plants failing, less money spent on altering the soil, and a lower environmental impact.</li>
          <li>As well as my expertise, you are gaining access to my network of landscapers, nurseries, suppliers, and even other designers. I frequently attend networking and development events.</li>

      <p class="text-lg">Every project is unique, and my services are tailored to your space and your needs. That being said, my offering to you can be broken down into three categories.</p>
