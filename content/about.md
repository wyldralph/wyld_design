**Your new-build or contemporary home deserves a garden that matches its quality and vision.**

I'm Ralph Wyld, garden designer and founder of Wyld Design. I specialise in creating exceptional gardens for discerning homeowners who want something truly special - spaces that provide privacy, support local wildlife, and deliver the wow-factor to complement your contemporary home.

**What sets my approach apart is the unexpected influence of my other creative passion: jazz music.** Just as a great jazz composition balances structure with flowing improvisation, my gardens combine clean architectural lines with naturalistic planting that moves and changes through the seasons. This unique perspective, backed by internationally-recognised diplomas from the Royal Horticultural Society and Capel Manor College, allows me to create gardens that are both sophisticated and dynamic.

**Working with me means getting someone who truly understands contemporary homes and their challenges.**
Since moving to Bedfordshire in 2021, I've focused specifically on the opportunities presented by new developments throughout the region. While these developments can impact local biodiversity, I see enormous potential in transforming their often-overlooked gardens into sanctuaries that benefit both you and local wildlife.

**My process is completely bespoke - every garden I design is as unique as the people who'll live in it.** Whether you're starting with a blank slate of builder's turf or refreshing an existing space, I'll work with you to create something that reflects your lifestyle, values, and vision.
The result? A garden that performs beautifully in every season - providing the privacy, beauty, and connection to nature that transforms your outdoor space into the sanctuary it should be.
