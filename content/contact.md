I'm currently available for new projects starting from **{{< next-month >}}**.

If you're ready to discuss your project, please {{< link href="mailto:hello@wylddesign.studio" text="send me an email" />}} or {{< link href="https://tidycal.com/wylddesign/discovery" target="_blank" text="book a short phone or video call" />}}.

I'd like to know about bit about you, your current garden, and what you're hoping to achieve. The _'perfect'_ enquiry might look something like this:

Hi Ralph,

We've just moved into a new-build home in [local village] and are looking to create a garden that feels like it belongs here. The house is contemporary with clean lines, and we love the surrounding countryside, but our plot feels quite disconnected from it all at the moment.

We're drawn to naturalistic planting and sustainable approaches, and we'd love a garden that changes through the seasons and supports local wildlife. Inside, our style is quite minimal with some mid-century pieces and contemporary art.

We're hoping to create something that feels rooted in this landscape rather than imposed upon it. We're prepared to invest properly in getting this right, and we're looking to start next spring.

Would you be available for a conversation about the project?

Kind regards,
