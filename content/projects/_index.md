From stories and observation, research and botany, every project has a narrative spark. A wood anemone found amongst the leaf litter, indicating ancient woodland, inspires a naturalistic planting design and sinuous trails. Cherished memories of a holiday in the Lakes become drystone walls and a bubbling water feature echoing mountain streams. The thematic essence guides the design, narrowing the myriad options, producing a garden that feels like it's always belonged.
