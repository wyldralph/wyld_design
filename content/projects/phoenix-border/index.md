I designed _The Phoenix Border_ to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Aldershot Town Football Club, a "phoenix club" which rose from the ashes of Aldershot FC in 1992. It was selected for display at the 2022 Belvoir Castle Flower and Garden Show by the **London College of Garden Design**.

## The Story

In March 1992 Aldershot FC, a football club at the heart of its community, folded and closed. Less than a month later, thanks to the passion and determination of those in and around the club, from the ashes of disaster rose the phoenix club Aldershot Town FC.

## The Design Concept

The planting scheme used fiery red and blue tones inspired by the club's colours, arranged around a striking focal point of corrugated iron that symbolizes the East Bank stand at the Recreation Ground, where Aldershot has hosted football since 1927. The centerpiece of the design is a callistemon (bottlebrush) plant, chosen as the border's _literal_ phoenix - this remarkable plant has seed capsules that remain dormant until wildfires arrive, then release seeds to bring new life from the ashes, perfectly embodying the phoenix story.

## The Result

The design for the Phoenix Border captured the imagination of the judges at the London College of Garden Design, and was selected for exhibition. The blank raised bed I was presented with was transformed into a vibrant scene, overflowing with energetic planting. Within minutes of the plants being delivered, they were buzzing with bees, demonstrating how quickly we can have an impact on wildlife in our gardens.
