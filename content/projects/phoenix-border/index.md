The Phoenix Border was designed to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Aldershot Town Football Club, a "phoenix club" which rose from the ashes of Aldershot FC in 1992. Selected for display at the 2022 Belvoir Castle Flower and Garden Show by the London College of Garden Design.

## The Challenge

The challenge was to create a meaningful garden design that would honor the story of Aldershot Town Football Club's rebirth while working within the constraints of a show garden format. The design needed to symbolically represent the phoenix narrative while incorporating the club's distinctive red and blue color palette.

## The Solution

The planting scheme used fiery red and blue tones inspired by the football club's colors, arranged around a striking focal point of corrugated iron that symbolizes the Recreation Ground where the club plays. The centerpiece of the design is a callistemon (bottlebrush) plant, chosen as the border's "literal phoenix" - this remarkable plant has seed capsules that remain dormant until wildfires arrive, then release seeds to bring new life from the ashes, perfectly embodying the phoenix story.

## The Result

The Phoenix Border successfully captured both the emotional resonance of the club's resurrection story and created a visually striking display that was selected for exhibition at one of the region's premier garden shows. The symbolic plant choices and thoughtful color palette created a garden that was both beautiful and deeply meaningful.
