Welcome to my journal, where I share thoughts and insights on garden design, seasonal gardening, plant selections, and the philosophy behind creating meaningful outdoor spaces.

Each journal entry explores different aspects of garden design - from practical tips for specific challenges to deeper reflections on how gardens connect us to nature and place.
