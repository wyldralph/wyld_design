## Living in a new-build in Bedfordshire? Here's how to create a private, peaceful garden you'll love to use

Perhaps the most common complaint about new-build gardens is their lack of privacy. Often overlooked by neighbours on one or more sides, homeowners feel uncomfortable about using their outside space for fear of being watched. Fortunately there are many ways to address this issue through creative garden design.

On a recent visit to the Appleyard in Flitton, Bedfordshire, I met with the proud owner of a new-build home. Her garden had so much potential, but there were two nearby properties which both had views into her new garden. One of her first questions for me was: "How do I make my garden feel more private?".

The traditional solution to a problem like this has been to throw in some fast-growing hedge. Leylandii can grow up to 90cm a year, and reach heights of over 12m. Whilst this might seem like a simple solution, this dense-growing hedge can cut out all your light, soak up lots of the moisture in the soil, and cause disputes with your neighbours.

Instead, read on to discover the best ways to design privacy into your new-build garden without compromising your style, or breaking the bank.

### Screening for new-build garden privacy

Screening is a simple principle: block the neighbours' view of you, or vice versa. However it doesn't have to be a 30ft hedge along your boundary. If a neighbouring window overlooks your patio, for example, could a single tree or large shrub be placed in the sightline? Careful placement of a single specimen can block the views without taking out all your sunlight.

You might also be surprised at how translucent screening can be, and still give you the desired effect. The fluttering leaves of a birch or swaying blades of Miscanthus grass, for example, give the feeling of seclusion, whilst allowing through lovely dappled light.

If you need a larger area of screening, pleached trees have a similar effect to a tall hedge, but with a much smaller footprint. There are many options, including evergreens such as Portuguese Laurel or the overused Red Robin, but Beech and Hornbeam are fantastic alternatives which turn a beautiful bronze in Autumn and hold their leaves over winter.

Screening doesn't only have to be through the use of plants. A pergola can give the feeling of privacy and seclusion, whilst giving you a flexible dining space. Many pergolas now come with the option of closable side panels and a closing louvred roof, for dialling up the privacy or protecting you from the elements. Metal or wooden screens offer a similar effect, and come in a variety of styles to suit any new-build garden.

### Design levels into the garden

A change in level can also bring a sense of privacy. If the middle of your garden feels overlooked, adding a sunken seating area, which lowers your eye level and drops it below the line of site from neighbouring windows, can feel very snug and secluded. Surrounding this area with perennial planting is a classic garden design trick which will enhance the cocooning effect, submerging you in the lush foliage.

### Sound matters

In many developments houses are close together, and you might feel self-conscious about being overheard by neighbours. Equally, perhaps you can hear neighbours' conversations, and you'd feel more comfortable if they were drowned out. A water feature, situated near where you sit, is an excellent solution to this. A garden designer can help you to find something that creates a gentle bubble (or a raging torrent, whichever you'd prefer!), and fits in with your style. Introducing water has the added benefit of encouraging wildlife, and there's a water feature suitable for every garden.

### Avoid the pitfalls

Watch out for these common problems:

- If you're going for a tree or shrub to screen, consider layering it into a wider planting area, so that it feels natural placed rather than sticking out like a sore thumb!
- When planning pergolas or screens, make sure you take into account the rules around heights! Check the [Interactive House](https://interactive.planningportal.co.uk/detached-house/outside/fences-gates-and-garden-walls) for details.
- For screening plants, don't just pick whatever looks nice when you visit the garden centre! Ask a knowledgeable plantsperson for advice, or even better contact a designer who can consider the best option for your space, soil, and light conditions. It's much cheaper to get things right first time!

### Garden Design Solutions for New-Build Privacy

Creating privacy in your new-build garden doesn't require sacrificing style, light, or good neighbourly-relations. With thoughtful garden design, you can transform an overlooked space into your personal sanctuary. Remember these key principles: strategically place screening elements where they'll have the most impact, consider changes in level to create secluded zones, and don't forget about sound privacy - a well-placed water feature works wonders for creating a peaceful atmosphere. Layer your planting for a natural look, check planning regulations before adding structures, and invest in professional advice to avoid costly mistakes. Whether you're in Bedfordshire or the surrounding areas, the right garden design can balance privacy with beauty in your new-build garden.
