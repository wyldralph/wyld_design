As the owner of a small garden myself, I'm acutely aware of the challenges they present. With the right approach, you can still have a space that delivers everything you need, but it requires careful planning up front. Here are some expert tips to help you make the most of your small outdoor space.

#### Work Out What You Really Need

When space is at a premium, every square centimetre counts. It's essential to streamline your garden wish list to the absolute must-haves. Instead of being swayed by the latest trends on Instagram or in glossy magazines, focus on how you want to use your garden. Do you need a space for entertaining, a quiet corner for reading, or a play area for children? Prioritising your needs will help you create a garden that is both functional and personal.

#### Use a Limited Palette of Plants and Materials

Simplicity is key in a small garden. Using a limited palette of plants and materials prevents the space from feeling cluttered and chaotic. Stick to a few types of plants and materials that complement each other to create a cohesive and relaxing oasis.

#### Choose Hard-Working Plants

#### Use Colour Trickery

Colour can significantly influence how we perceive space. Use this to your advantage and make your small garden feel larger. Painting boundary walls or fences black can make them disappear into the background, drawing more attention to the plants in front and creating a sense of depth.

Additionally, cool colours like blues and purples appear to recede, so planting them at the far end of a garden can make it feel more expansive. Conversely, warm colours like reds, yellows, and oranges catch the eye and appear closer, so plant them near the house to create a vibrant and inviting entrance.

#### Conclusion

By following these tips, you can transform your small garden into a beautiful and functional space that feels much larger than it is. At Wyld Design, we create stunning gardens that maximise every inch of space.
