I design gardens which tell the stories of their owners, and the wider landscape to which they belong. Local geography and history, plants and wildlife, and the houses and interiors all inform my creative practice.

Gardens are important in connecting us to the natural environment; the changing seasons, weather and climate; and the cycles that all life are eternally engaged in. In new-build homes, where the connection to the land has been lost, gardens can reestablish that relationship, and enrich the lives of those who use them. Through a clear, collaborative [design process](/process), I guide you from initial consultation through to planting completion.
