A comprehensive planting design that transformed tired borders into a naturalistic paradise filled with seasonal interest and wildlife appeal.

## The Challenge

The client's established Buckinghamshire garden had good bones but lackluster planting that provided little seasonal interest and minimal wildlife value.

## The Solution

I designed a prairie-inspired planting scheme using hardy perennials and grasses that provide structure and color from spring through winter.

## The Result

The garden now buzzes with activity throughout the seasons, providing endless interest and a true wildlife haven.
