Every garden is different, and the process is tailored to your needs. That being said, a typical garden redesign
usually works as follows:

We'll arrange a call to discuss your project, so I can find out more about what you're looking for, what your
garden is like now, and practical considerations like time-frames and budget.

If we're a good fit, we'll arrange for me to come and meet you, and see the garden. At this point I'll take a brief, so I understand the scope of the project, as well as getting to know you and your style. I'll send you a detailed Project Proposal for your consideration, including a breakdown of my fees, and my Terms of Engagement.

We organise a survey of the garden. Depending on the scale and complexity of the space, this might be
completed by me, or by a trusted third-party. Either way, I also make observations about the site
including aspect, light, drainage, and soil characteristics.

The creative work begins, and I produce you a concept design. This includes mood-boards and a plan for the
garden, showing the proposed layout and style. Optionally, I can produce stunning 3D visualisations which
really capture the feel of the proposed space. With your feedback, we make some small revisions, before
you sign-off on the design.

With the concept design complete, I create detailed technical documentation including a Masterplan. This
contains all the information landscapers need to build your garden with precision, and ensure there are no
costly mistakes. In addition, a Bill of Quantities and associated documents will make for a smooth and
fair tendering process with landscapers. If the project calls for it, lighting and irrigation plans can
also be produced.

Once a landscaper has been contracted, and you're ready to start, the garden can be built. I'm available
throughout this process to advise and assist, and answer any questions which arise over the design.

After the hard landscaping has been completed, the planting can take place. I draw up a planting plan and
accompanying mood-board, so you can get an impression of the character and style. I can source the plants
from reliable trade nurseries, and plant them, giving them the best introduction to their new conditions.

My input doesn't end with the completion of the build, as I help to ensure the garden establishes well,
and guide maintenance efforts.
