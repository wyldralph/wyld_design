Specialized planting design service focusing on creating beautiful, sustainable plant combinations that thrive
in your specific garden conditions.

Every garden is different, and my process is tailored to your needs. However a typical planting design usually
works as follows:

We'll discuss your project over the phone, so I can find out more about what you're looking for, how I can
help develop your planting scheme, and practical considerations like time-frames and budget.

If we're a good fit, we'll arrange for me to come and meet you, and see the areas to be planted. At this
point I'll take a brief, so I understand the scope of the project, as well as getting to know you and your
style. I'll send you a detailed Project Proposal for your consideration, including a breakdown of my fees,
and my Terms of Engagement.

We organise a survey of the planting areas, including important horticultural observations regarding
aspect, light, drainage, and soil characteristics. This will ensure the planting scheme is designed to
thrive in your unique space, and has the best chance of establishing successfully. If you have existing
plants you're keeping, or would like to move, I'll also identify and locate them.

I create a mood-board and planting plan, showing you the style and character of the proposed planting
scheme. This will allow me to draw up precise plant lists used to order from nurseries. I can source the
plants from my network of reliable trade growers, and plant them for you if you would like.

To ensure the plants establish effectively, I will provide a maintenance schedule which you (or a
gardener) can use to ensure you have happy, healthy plants. I can continue to visit the garden and consult
as the scheme develops over time.
